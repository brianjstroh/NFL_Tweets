    "In the late 1970's, the Dallas Cowboys were coined as \"America's Team\" (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Team ). A lot has changed since the 70's and whereas the Cowboys are leading their division with a baffling record of 6-7, I believe they are no longer the most exciting organization in football.\n",

    "The goal of this project will be to identify the modern day \"America's Team\". The criteria will be the most popular team as determined by number of tweets mentioning the NFL teams in the time frame of 12/6/2019 to 12/10/2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of the data analysis stem from the data collection process. In order to prevent the API from being overloaded or exploited, Twitter's Streaming API limits the number of tweets that can be extracted. Fortunately, all NFL teams have games this week, so the analysis will not be skewed from that perspective. However, the Cowboys and Bears game was a day before the tweets began to be collected, so there may be a slight under-representation of those two teams, as their most exciting moments of the week have passed."
